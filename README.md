# Tolerable Discord

A small Firefox extension that rolls back some of the
[enshittification](https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456) currently in progress
at Discord, mostly aimed at reducing visual clutter and improving performance.

## List of changes

- The Nitro and Shop links are hidden from the `Direct Messages` page.
- Animated avatar decorations and animated profile effects will no longer appear either in profiles
  or in the channels.
- "Discover" and "Download App" buttons are gone from the sidebar.
- Removed the Nitro gift button that for some perplexing reason appears in every chat box and is
  absolutely never used.
- The boost progress bar is permanently disabled for all servers.
- Disabled promotional banners for annoying games.
- Removed the new title bar
- Re-docked the bottom user profile island
- Reverted the new colour scheme (dark mode only)

## Planned changes

These are not available yet.

- Severely reducing the animations associated with super reacts (leave only the glowing colored
  reaction badge)
- Add light mode colour scheme support
